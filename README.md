# Init Tracker

## Overview

This Init Tracker is a simple tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) initiative tracker designed to help Game Masters (GMs) manage and organize player and NPC initiatives during gaming sessions.
This uses the browser's local storage capabilities to store character initiative order between sessions, track combat rounds and turns, and manage hit points (HP).

To determine initiative, it uses a simple sorting of the initiative and dexterity scores (for a tie breaker).
